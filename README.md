# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures (COMP-1828)

**Coursework Project**

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures as part of the COMP-1828 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures module coursework. All rights belong to the educational institution.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several components:

- `clrsPython/` - Contains algorithm implementations organized by chapter
- `task1/`, `task2/`, `task3/`, `task4/` - Task-specific implementation folders
- `utils/` - Utility functions and data processing modules
- `data/` - Data files for testing and analysis

## Getting Started

### For Contributors Working on Chapter Implementations

When working on a specific chapter in the `clrsPython/` directory, please ensure you:

1. **Add an `__init__.py` file** to the chapter folder you are working on if its not there already.
2. **Include the necessary import statements** in your task files
3. If both did not resolve the problem you will have to correct the import by adding the right modules in front of the called function.
    - If you do not know how to do that just let Mikolaj know and ill help you.

### For Contributors Working on Task Implementations

Before you even get started make sure you create a fork in your desginated pair and work on that section specifically, push your work to github often so the team leader is up to date with everyones work. This will also make it easier for everyone to help one another with the work as everyone will have the up to date version.

When working on task-specific implementations in the `task1/`, `task2/`, `task3/`, or `task4/` folders, please add the following import statements at the top of your Python files:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
```

This ensures that your task files can properly import modules from the `clrsPython` directory.

## Example Implementation

### Chapter 11 Example

If you're working on Chapter 11 (Hash Tables) and need to use the implementations in your task:

**Step 1:** Ensure `clrsPython/Chapter11/` has an `__init__.py` file.

**Step 2:** In your task file (e.g., `task2/main.py`), add the import statements:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))

# Now you can import from Chapter11
from clrsPython.Chapter11.chained_hashtable import ChainedHashTable
from clrsPython.Chapter11.hash_functions import hash_function_division
from clrsPython.Chapter11.open_address_hashtable import OpenAddressHashTable

```

## Available Chapters

The following chapters are available in the `clrsPython/` directory:

Online table of contents with coresponding pages to [Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gre/detail.action?docID=6925615) can be found [here](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/4e_toc.pdf)

## Data Files

The `data/` directory contains datasets that can be used for testing and analysis of the implemented algorithms.

## Contributing

When contributing to this project:

1. Follow the import structure guidelines outlined above
2. Ensure all chapter folders have `__init__.py` files
3. Add appropriate documentation to your implementations
4. Test your code thoroughly before submission

## Academic Integrity

This is coursework for COMP-1828 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures. All implementations should be original work, and any external references should be properly cited. All rights belong to the educational institution.
